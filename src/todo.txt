    - rate songs/albums/artists using Spotify API, and keep backlog of albums to listen to
    - show more info on music; artist, cover, and description of artist
- title, favicon
- all icons colours, ensure theme is correct
- need to be able to rearrange order, mention in readme
- how to only have 1 doc per user, a lot of data
- mobile friendly scroll
- my own guest music lol

It appears you haven't rated music yet! Add music to the backlog. Once rated, it'll appear here.

"Note that the free tier of the Spotify API being used, only allows for 1000 queries per month; so use sparingly"

"The app uses YouTube Music's free API, as their free tier has a sufficiently large limit, 
and their free tier is capped at 1 query/second which avoids too many queries being sent per keystroke while
searching for tracks".

flow:
- library has rated songs
    - ratings can be updated here
- backlog is purely for adding songs
    - once song is rated in backlog, it's removed from backlog

next step:
- retrieve something from API, what can be retrieved
- ammend this to display, card design
- search suggestions, most important, clicking on these is what actually adds
